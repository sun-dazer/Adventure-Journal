# Trail Tales

## Project Overview

Trail Tales is a web-based application that allows users to track their outdoor activities, such as hiking and climbing, and connect with others in the community. It helps users document their adventures, set goals, and earn awards based on their achievements. The app features profile pages, a tips forum, and an exploration page where users can discover new hikes based on location. It is designed for hikers who want to create memories of their outdoor experiences while building a supportive network.

Unlike other fitness apps, this application emphasizes goal-based achievements and social interaction through journaling, providing users with a meaningful way to reflect on their outdoor experiences.

## Project Features

- **Profile Pages**: Users can create and maintain profiles documenting their hikes and climbs. Profiles show statistics like the number of hikes, miles hiked, and places traveled. Users earn awards based on their achievements.
  
- **Explore Page**: Users can browse through different hikes and outdoor activities based on location.
  
- **Search Feature**: Users can search for other users or specific hiking locations to connect with friends or discover new places to visit.
  
- **Tips Forum**: A community-driven tips forum where users can share survival and outdoor tips.

- **Goals**: Users can set future goals, whether it's reaching a specific destination or hiking a certain number of miles.

- **Map Integration**: Each profile includes an interactive map with pins that track the user's hikes.
